# AI Code Security Debt Scorer

Static security analysis for pasted or uploaded source code, with line-level findings,
SQLite-backed scan history, mock-AI fallback, optional server-side LLM enrichment, and PDF reports.

## Layout

```
security-debt-scorer/
  backend/   FastAPI + SQLite + AST/Bandit/Semgrep analysis
  frontend/  Vite + React + Material UI + Axios
  tests/     Playwright e2e workspace (pre-scaffolded)
```

## Run locally (Windows PowerShell)

Install backend dependencies and start the API in one terminal:

```powershell
cd backend
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
uvicorn server:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

Install frontend dependencies and start Vite in a second terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --workspaces=false
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The Vite server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:8001`.
SQLite is created automatically at `backend/security_scans.db`; no database server is required.
Set `AI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` to enable optional OpenAI-compatible explanation enrichment.
Without a key, the analyzer remains fully usable in `MOCK_AI` mode. Source code is never executed.

Run backend checks from `backend` with `python -m pytest -n 0`; run the frontend production
check from `frontend` with `npm run build`.

## API proxy convention

Every backend route lives under `/api` (the backend mounts one
`APIRouter(prefix="/api")`), and the frontend dev server
(`frontend/vite.config.ts`) proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8001`. So
frontend code always calls a **relative** path — `apiGet("/status")` →
`/api/status` — and never an absolute backend URL. The same code works in dev
(via the Vite proxy) and in production (once both are served behind a single
origin).

## Backend details

FastAPI serves the scan endpoints under `/api`; scan handlers retain JSON contracts and
persist through a repository module so SQLite can later be replaced by PostgreSQL.

- **Entry point**: `backend/server.py` — creates `app = FastAPI()`, creates
  `api_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api")`, registers routes **on the router**,
  and calls `app.include_router(api_router)` at the bottom. CORS middleware is
  added from `CORS_ORIGINS`. Never hang a route directly off `app` — it would
  land outside `/api` and the Vite proxy would not reach it.
- **The route pattern** (copy `status` in `server.py`):
  1. a Pydantic model per request body and per response
     (`StatusCheckCreate` / `StatusCheck`);
  2. an `async def` handler decorated with
     `@api_router.post("/status", response_model=StatusCheck)`;
  3. Call the persistence repository from the async handler.
  FastAPI validates the request against the Pydantic model before your handler
  runs — a malformed body never reaches your code, it gets an automatic `422`
  with a `{"detail": [...]}` body.
- **Growing the backend**: as `server.py` gets crowded, move models to
  `backend/models/` and routers to `backend/routers/` (one module per resource,
  each exporting its own `APIRouter`, mounted from `server.py` via
  `api_router.include_router(...)` or `app.include_router(...)` with the `/api`
  prefix preserved).
- **SQLite**: `backend/lib/db.py` owns schema initialization and scan/status
  persistence. Set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///security_scans.db` or `SQLITE_PATH`
  in `.env` to choose another local database file.
- **Ids**: scans use UUID string identifiers, so API responses remain portable
  between SQLite and a future PostgreSQL repository.
- **Config**: copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`. Keep AI credentials
  server-side; React never receives API keys.
- **Interactive check**: `cd backend; python -c 'import server'` catches
  syntax/import errors without waiting for the supervisor log.

## Frontend

- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript strict, Material UI dark theme, Axios API client,
  and dev server on port `3000`.
- Tailwind CSS v4 (via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin — no separate
  `tailwind.config.js` needed) + shadcn/ui, initialized with the `base-nova`
  style and `neutral` base color, `@` path alias (`@/*` → `src/*`) wired in both
  `tsconfig.app.json`/`tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`.
- `react-router-dom` and `motion` are preinstalled — don't re-add them. `src/App.tsx`
  is the `<Routes>` table and nothing else; screens live in `src/pages/*.tsx` and are
  imported as `@/pages/<Name>`. `src/pages/Home.tsx` ships as the worked example. Add
  a `<Route>` for every page you write, in the same edit that creates the page — a
  page with no route is unreachable, and any URL without a matching `<Route>` renders a
  **blank page** — `<Routes>` matches nothing and mounts nothing.
- Components installed under `src/components/ui/`: button, card, input, label,
  select, dialog, sheet, tabs, badge, calendar, sonner, textarea, table, popover,
  dropdown-menu, checkbox. Add more with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
- `src/lib/api.ts` — the typed fetch layer: `apiGet<T>`, `apiPost<T>`,
  `apiPut<T>`, `apiPatch<T>`, `apiDelete<T>`, all relative to base `/api`,
  throwing `ApiError` (with `status` and the parsed body) on any non-2xx.
  **Nothing infers across the Python boundary** — you declare the response type
  yourself as a TS interface mirroring the endpoint's Pydantic model, and keeping
  the two in sync is a manual discipline. When you change a Pydantic model,
  change its TS interface in the same edit.
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` is a minimal example of the wiring: TanStack Query's `useQuery`
  with `apiGet<StatusCheck[]>("/status")` as the `queryFn`. It is a **non-blocking
  connectivity probe**, not a proof of the round trip — the result is deliberately
  discarded so the splash renders identically with no backend. `apiGet<T>` does no
  runtime validation either; `T` is your assertion, not a check. See the
  static-preview rule in `TEMPLATE.md` §4 for why no page may be gated on a fetch.

## TypeScript

`frontend/tsconfig.app.json` / `tsconfig.node.json` have `strict: true`. In the
pod:

```bash
cd frontend && yarn typecheck
```

— plain `tsc --noEmit` run from `frontend/` checks ZERO files (root tsconfig uses
project references with `"files": []`) and exits 0 even with type errors. Always
use `-b` for the frontend. Lint with `cd frontend && yarn lint` (oxlint).

## Data fetching

TanStack Query is wired: `QueryClientProvider` in `src/main.tsx`, `useQuery` demo
in `src/pages/Home.tsx` (see above). Use `useQuery`/`useMutation`, not
fetch-in-`useEffect`.

## Completion gate (tier 1)

When the build is complete, run tier 1 once, all in the same turn: a curl smoke
over the key `/api` endpoints (assert status AND a response field, plus one
negative case), `cd frontend && yarn typecheck`, and ONE happy-path browser pass
through the core user journey. Clean on all three → finish; any failure is a real
bug — fix it, re-run the failed check, and escalate to the testing subagent.
No routine typecheck/lint/smoke passes during the build — tier 1 runs exactly once.


## Testing

Two lanes.

**Backend (pytest)** — specs in `backend/tests/` as `test_*.py`, run with:

```bash
cd /app/backend && pytest
```

`backend/pytest.ini` is canonical: `addopts = -n 2 --dist loadscope` (pytest-xdist,
already parallel — do not pass your own `-n`) and `asyncio_mode = auto` (so
`async def test_...` needs no marker). Serial is `-n 0`, **never**
`-p no:xdist` (that errors, because `addopts` still passes `-n`/`--dist`).
`backend/tests/conftest.py` is pre-scaffolded — a sync `client` fixture
(`httpx.Client` rooted at `/api`), an async `aclient`, and an `api_url()` helper,
all pointed at `BACKEND_URL` (default `http://localhost:8001`). Tests hit the
live uvicorn process, so the app under test is the one the browser sees. Add
app-specific fixtures below the marker; do not re-create the file.

**Frontend (Playwright)** — `/app/tests/` is pre-scaffolded:
`playwright.config.ts` (canonical — edit the marked lines only),
`fixtures/helpers.ts`, and a `package.json` that resolves
`@playwright/test@1.62.0` (node_modules baked into the image). Write specs into
`tests/e2e/`. Do NOT re-create the config/helpers or install/upgrade playwright —
matching Chromium browsers live at `/pw-browsers`.

The backend lane is pytest: this template's backend is Python, so `vitest` does
not apply to it.

## Pod conventions

This template runs under supervisord in the Emergent agent pod — supersedes any
local-run instructions above.

- Backend, frontend, and `mongod` are each a supervisor program. After code or
  config changes, restart and wait for readiness:

  ```powershell
  # Local development uses one terminal for each command; no supervisor or MongoDB is required.
  cd backend; python -m uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8001
  cd frontend; npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
  ```

- Status, only after a restart you triggered:
  `sudo supervisorctl status frontend backend`. Logs:
  `/var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log`, `backend.out.log`,
  `frontend.err.log`.
- App in a browser: the pod's preview URL (frontend, port `3000`). Backend API
  directly at port `8001`.
- SQLite is initialized automatically on backend startup; the optional AI API
  key is read only by FastAPI from `backend/.env`.
- Both dev servers hot-reload on file edits (uvicorn `--reload` for the backend,
  Vite HMR for the frontend); no rebuild step needed for normal iteration. A
  restart is still needed after changing `.env`, `requirements.txt`, or
  `vite.config.ts`.
